# [RFC 8594, "The Sunset HTTP Header Field", May 2019](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8594)

When a resource or an API is about to be retired, it would be useful for consumers of that resource/API to be notified in advance. By using an HTTP field, this information can be conveyed in-band, instead of having to rely on out-of-band channels such as announcements that are published on Web pages or sent by email.
