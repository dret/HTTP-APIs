# [RFC 8288, "Web Linking", October 2017](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8288)

Many APIs take advantage of links as an important way to relate resources and to guide interactions with the API. For links to be meaningful they must have a type associated with them, so that clients can understand what links represent, and can choose which links to follow. Web linking introduces the idea of a general mechanism for link types, establishes a registry of types so that types can be reused, and it also defines a way how links can be represented in an HTTP field.
