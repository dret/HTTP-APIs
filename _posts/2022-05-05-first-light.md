This took much longer than it should have, but finally there's a first version of the site, and there's a first published video on [the channel](http://youtube.com/ErikWilde). There are many more to come and there are many things that can be improved with how the site is organized and managed.

But: As long as the videos can remain published, there's a good foundation to build on, and that's going to be the new approach going forward with this little project.

If you have any ideas how to improve the site or what specifications you would like to see covered, please get in touch. This site is going to be under construction for quite a while, but feedback will always help to make it better and more useful!
