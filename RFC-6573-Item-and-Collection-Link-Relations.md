# [RFC 6573, "Item and Collection Link Relations", April 2012](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6573)

Link relation values can be used to indicate _why_ an application would active a link or form. RFC 6573 defines two possible reasons for activating (or following) links: to reach a `collection` or to view an `item` in a collection. Response representations that include these link relation values are identifying which links return collections and which links return items from a collection.
