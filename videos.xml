        <title>The Sunset HTTP Header Field</title>
        <tagline>Resources and APIs disappear at some point in time; the Sunset field allows to advertise that event to clients.</tagline>
        <link type="youtube" id="XXX"/>
        <description>When a resource or an API is about to be retired, it would be useful for consumers of that resource/API to be notified in advance. By using an HTTP field, this information can be conveyed in-band, instead of having to rely on out-of-band channels such as announcements that are published on Web pages or sent by email.</description>
