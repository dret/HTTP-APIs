        <description>When a resource or an API is about to be retired, it would be useful for consumers of that resource/API to be notified in advance. By using an HTTP field, this information can be conveyed in-band, instead of having to rely on out-of-band channels such as announcements that are published on Web pages or sent by email.</description>
